# Product Listing Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Product Listing and Product Detail application** built as part of a frontend assignment. The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate clean UI design, proper routing, component-based architecture, and production-ready React practices.

The application allows users to:

* View a list of products
* Navigate to a detailed product page
* Move back to the product list seamlessly

The project is built using **React**, **React Router**, **Styled Components**, and **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** – Component-based UI development
* **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing for list and detail views
* **Styled Components** – Scoped, maintainable styling using CSS-in-JS
* **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern JavaScript features

---

## 🔀 Routing Overview

The application uses **React Router** for navigation:

* `/` → Product Listing Page
* `/product/:id` → Product Detail Page

Each product card links to its respective detail page. A **Back button** is provided on the detail page to return to the product listing.

---

## 🎨 Styling Approach

All styling is implemented using **Styled Components**:

* Styles are scoped to individual components
* No global CSS conflicts
* Easier maintenance and reuse
* Supports dynamic styling via props
